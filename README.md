# Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository showcasing various Deep Learning projects! ðŸš€ Each project highlights different applications and implementations within the exciting world of Deep Learning.

## [Stock Price Prediction using LSTM](https://github.com/aayushsoni4/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Stock%20Price%20Prediction)

Dive into the world of financial forecasting! This project harnesses the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict stock prices. Discover how LSTM, a specialized recurrent neural network, can effectively forecast stock trends based on historical data.

### Features:
- Explore historical stock data
- Leverage LSTM architecture for time series prediction
- Assess model performance using evaluation metrics

## [Breast Cancer Classification using ANN](https://github.com/aayushsoni4/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Classification)

Join the fight against breast cancer with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)! This project focuses on classifying breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using ANN models. Explore how these models analyze medical imaging features to aid in early diagnosis.

### Features:
- Utilize ANN for binary classification
- Perform breast cancer diagnosis based on extracted features
- Evaluate model performance and gain insightful analysis
